# Algorithm-Playground

🚀 DSA Journey with Java
This repo tracks my progress as I learn and implement core data structures and algorithms using Java.
It includes:

✅ Clean, working code for sorting, searching, recursion, and more

📚 Practice problems from LeetCode, GFG, and custom challenges

✍️ My notes and thought process behind each approach

I'm building this repo as both a revision tool and a public log of my grind toward mastering problem-solving.
Pull requests, suggestions, and challenges are welcome!
